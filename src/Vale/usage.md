At its core, Vale is designed to be used as a command-line tool. Its general usage information is given below:

```shell
$ vale --help
NAME:

    vale [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
    vX.X.X

COMMANDS:
        dump-config, dc  Dumps configuration options to stdout and exits
        new              Generates a template for the given extension point
        help, h          Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
    --glob value     a glob pattern (e.g., --glob='*.{md,txt}') (default: "*")

Vale's `--glob` argument accepts the [standard syntax](http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm). Additionally,
any pattern prefixed with an `!` will be nagated&mdash;e.g.,

```shell
$ vale --glob='!*.bin' directory  # Exclude all xxx.bin files
```
