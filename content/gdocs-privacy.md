# Vale Privacy Policy

The Vale Google Docs add-on works by sending the text to be checked to our
servers over an encrypted connection. This policy describes how we handle the
transmitted text.

## Data Collection

We no not collect or distribute any information about you or the documents sent
to our servers.

## Data Usage

The Vale add-on will ask for permission to access the current Google Doc, which
we need to send its contents to our remote servers. The Vale add-on reads the
content and structure of your documents, but it does not change any content.

The Vale add-on will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the
sidebar to display a list of alerts (if found) about your content.

It requires no other permissions.

## More information

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-server) for
documentation and installation instructions.
