# Google Docs Privacy Policy

The Vale Google Docs add-on does not collect or distribute any information about
you or the documents it checks.

## Permissions

The Vale add-on will ask for permission to access the current Doc (to check it
against your style guide). Vale reads the content and structure of your
documents, but it does not change any content.

The Vale add-on will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the
sidebar to display a list of alerts (if found) about your content.

It requires no other permissions.

## More information

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-server) for
documentation and installation instructions.
