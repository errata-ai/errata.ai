# Terms of Service

The name "Vale Server" refers to the services available on the macOS, Windows, or Linux desktop application, errata.ai, and all subdomains. "We" or "I" refers to the owner(s) of the Service. By using Vale Server, you agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement") and to our Privacy Policy. This Agreement applies to anyone (including visitors, users, and others) who access Vale Server or its website (a "User" or "Users").

Vale Server reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

## Cancellation and Termination

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account and any subscription payment associated with it. A request to cancel your account or subscription via email, phone, or any social platform is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time through your Gumroad account. You will find access to a simple, no questions asked cancellation link there. Your information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

Vale Server, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Vale Server reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason, at any time.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to Vale Server.
